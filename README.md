# DotNet3-Apps
Apps from .Net 3.0 preview; WPF, WinForms and Blazor Apps


## .Net 3.0 Preview
WPF, WinForms are back in business

## WPF
Need to find DI. 

## There is new Web Application Project
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.0

## Blazor App
I have created a simple app just to check the Blazor.
I found the Blazor is very simple and easy to follow. 

And I have a feeling that the blazor is very similar to VueJs.
